# Better Meowmere #

Compared to the original in Terraria, the meowmere is a little lackluster in Stardew Valley. Better Meowmere aims to rectify this problem by improving the behaviour of the sword in [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) to be more similar to Terraria (along with all the annoying sound effects).

Better meowmere adds a rainbow cat projectile (altered to look a little more stardew-y) that it shot straight ahead when using the secondary attack. The attack of the sword is also buffed to be as overpowered as it is in Terraria (the projectile does do less damage than the sword).

A few config options are also included to customise your meowmere experience. Listed below:

- LessAnnoyingProjectile (default is false): If the meow sound effect gets too annoying, set this to true and the projectile will no longer meow when bouncing on walls.
- ProjectileIsSecondaryAttack (default is true): Projectile is shot using the secondary attack, set this to false if you want the projectile to be shot using the primary attack instead (this would be more in line with how the weapon functions in Terraria)
- BuffAttack (default is true): Makes the sword deal more damage. Set this to false for the sword to deal its' default damage (if you want the projectile without the buffing of the sword).
